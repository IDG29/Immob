Documents describing the parameters used in the control files to configure the different components of Pele++.

JSONSchemas contains the JSON schemas for the control file. Sections of the
complete control file schema are directly under JSONSchemas/ directory. The
actual schemas for each kind of command (and the initialization part)
are under JSONSchemas/Autogenerated/.

To generate the schemas, run from here (the Documents/ directory):

    python generateSchemas.py
    
and you will find the generated files under JSONSchemas/Autogenerated/

To generate the documentation, move to Documents/user/, and run

    make html

You will need Sphinx (http://sphinx-doc.org/) in order to do so.
    
The generated HTML documentation will appear under Documents/user/_build/html/

The old documentation is still available under Documents/old/, but must
not be modified.
